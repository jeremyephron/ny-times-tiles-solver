# NY Times Tiles Solver

In an effort to convince people that certain tasks are better left to our 
machine overlords, this is a simple program I wrote to play the NY Times 
online puzzle Tiles (more information can be found at 
https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/tiles), and because apparently I have too much 
time on my hands.

## Usage

Clone this repository, or download the ZIP file.

This program requires the `selenium` python package, which you can install 
with `pip3 install selenium`

The program is set to use `chromedriver` so you'll need Google Chrome and 
`chromedriver` in your PATH.

Then simply run with `python3 tiles_solver.py`.
